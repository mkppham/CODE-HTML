            The two types of pollination are: self-pollination and cross-pollina-tion.
            Self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposit-ed
            on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant.
            cross-pollination is the transfer of plloen from the anther of one flower
            to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same 
            spe-cies.</p>
